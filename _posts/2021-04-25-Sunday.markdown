This incredible stillness, seemingly only achievable in the outskirts of a small German town on a Sunday afternoon.  
The early spring birds, trying to disrupt it.   
Their efforts, hopelessly drowned in its vacuum.  
Rapeseed fields, as far as the eye can see, sunbathing to the side.  
Me, sitting on a park bench, setting up the scene for the better part of an afternoon.
