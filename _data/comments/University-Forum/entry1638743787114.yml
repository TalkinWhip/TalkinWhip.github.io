message: "Good afternoon! \r\n \r\nNewsletters  via follow-up forms to the sites of firms via all domain zones of the world.  \r\n \r\nhttps://xn----7sbb1bbndheurc1a.xn--p1ai/ \r\n \r\nWHAT IS THE MAILING OF INTERNET RESOURCES BY CONTACT FORMS? \r\nThis is a type of mailing using the contact forms that are located in the feedback section of the website and filled by our programme in a preset mode with a rate of a few thousand feedback forms per 1 minute, while the alphanumeric code from the pictures (captcha) is also solved. \r\nAfter that, the letters including your cooperation offers are sent to the e-mails of firms. \r\nWhen sending mailing by contact feedback forms, it turns out that each internet resource sends a letter “to itself” and, therefore, all messages arrive in the inbox of the exact electronic address in which the business receives the commercial information. \r\n \r\nUTP: \r\nFast 100-percent informing of businesses and internet resource owners about new cooperation offers. \r\nSearch of new customers that other types of advertisements cannot find. \r\n \r\nAIM: \r\nFinding new customers that cannot be found through other types of advertisements. \r\n \r\nBenefits: \r\n1.one hundred percent delivery of cooperation offers. \r\n2.Expansion of the client base. \r\n3.

Entering the international markets. \r\n \r\nOur advantages: \r\n \r\n1.When sending mailing by feedback forms, all e-mails arrive in the inbox. When sending mass e-mails, this can reach up to 5 percent. \r\n \r\n2.When sending mailing by contact forms it is possible to send a few million e-mails per 24 hours to inboxes. When sending bulk e-mails a few thousands arrive in the inboxes, all the rest often either do not reach or fill the spam. \r\n \r\n3. When sending mailing by feedback forms a letter does not get blocked by mails because it is sent from different sites. When sending mass e-mails it is possible to send a few thousands of those but nevertheless all the IP addresses from which the mailing is sent will be blocked. \r\n \r\n4. When sending mailing by feedback forms the minimum of macro-synonims is used to form text and headings of the letter. When sending e-newsletters, it is necessary to use «macros» (synonyms) for each phrase and create ten thousand various headings. \r\n \r\n5. Many organisations deliberatelly hide their mailbox and only leave a contact form for contacting with them. \r\n \r\n6. When sending mass e-mails, your business offer can be delivered to every employee of the firm, (which causes irritation) compared to mailing by contact forms where the letter is received at the e-mail address specifically set up for  cooperation  offers. \r\n \r\n7.Fifty % of business emails are located on free mail servers, they are not very \"searchable\" by e-mail, but when sending mailing by contact forms through these mail systems, all e-mails are 100% delivered to the recipients. \r\n \r\n8. Only thirty-forty percent of organisations get into the directories within 2-3 years, and all the other ones are already placed in our WHOIS databases and are waiting for your commercial offers. \r\nThus that emails of firms from directories are spammed, which means that they will not have such outcome as when sending mailing by feedback forms using our new VOIS databases. \r\n \r\n9. Any kind of stop words in the headings or body of the message can be sent through forms. When sending e-mail newsletters, such messages either are not delivered the recipient or arrive in junk. \r\nThe list of stop words of mail systems includes almost all phrases and words that encourage recipients to take actions. \r\n \r\nApplication: \r\n \r\n1.
