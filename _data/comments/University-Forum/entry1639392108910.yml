When sending mass e-mails, this can reach up to 5%. \r\n \r\n2.When sending mailing by contact forms it is possible to send a few million e-mails per day to inbox folders. When sending e-mail newsletters a few thousands arrive in the inbox folders, the rest often either are not delivered or fill the spam. \r\n \r\n3. When sending mailing by feedback forms a letter does not get blocked by mail services because it is sent from different sites. When sending bulk e-mails it is possible to send a few thousands of those but nevertheless all the IP addresses from which the mailing is sent will be banned. \r\n \r\n4.

Many businesses deliberatelly hide their mailbox and only leave a contact form for contacting with them. \r\n \r\n6.

Only thirty-forty percent of organisations get into the directories within several years, and all the other ones are already placed in our WHOIS databases and are waiting for your cooperation  offers. \r\nIt turns out that that e-mails of companies from directories are filled with spam, which means that they will not have such monetisation as when sending mailing by feedback forms using our new WHOIS databases. \r\n \r\n9. Any kind of stop words in the body or headings of the message can be sent through feedback forms. When sending bulk e-mails, such letters either do not reach the recipient or arrive in spam. \r\nThe list of stop words of mails includes almost all words and phrases that encourage recipients to take actions. \r\n \r\nApplication: \r\n \r\n1.
