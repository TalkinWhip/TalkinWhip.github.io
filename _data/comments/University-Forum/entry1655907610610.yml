When sending e-newsletters a few thousands arrive in the inbox folders, the rest often either are not delivered or arrive in the junk. \r\n \r\n3. When sending mailing by contact forms an e-mail does not get blocked by mail services because it is sent from different internet resources. When sending mass e-mails it is possible to send a few thousands of those but nevertheless all the IP addresses from which the mailing is sent will be blocked. \r\n \r\n4. When sending mailing by contact forms the minimum of macros is used to form text and headings of the letter. When sending bulk e-mails, it is necessary to use «macros» (synonyms) for each word and create thousands various headings. \r\n \r\n5. A lot of companies try to hide their email and only leave a contact form for contacting with them. \r\n \r\n6. When sending bulk e-mails, your cooperation offer is delivered to every employee of the firm, (which causes discontent) compared to mailing by feedback forms where the letter is received at the email specifically set up for  cooperation  offers. \r\n \r\n7.half of corporate mailboxes are located on free mail systems, they are poorly \"searchable\" by email, but when sending mailing by contact forms through these mail servers, all letters are one hundred percent delivered to the recipients. \r\n \r\n8. Only 30%-40% of firms are placed in the directories within several years, and all the other ones are already placed in our VOIS databases and are waiting for your business offers. \r\nThus that e-mails of organisations from directories are full of spam, and therefore they will not have such monetisation as when sending mailing by contact forms using our new VOIS databases. \r\n \r\n9. Any kind of stop words in the body or headings of the message can be sent through contact forms. When sending bulk e-mails, such letters either do not reach the recipient or end up in spam. \r\nThe list of stop words of mail systems includes almost all words and phrases that encourage recipients to take active actions. \r\n \r\nApplication: \r\n \r\n1.
